#journal So today is weird I'm trying to not be too new years resolutiony, but i can't help it.  I have been talking to Heather and she thinks that the best way for me to get through this rut (finances personal) is to start writing everything down.

That way I won't be too stressed. I was thinking about a combination of mindump and journaling exercises .
